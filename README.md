### Machine Learning Features
1. **Check Nutrition and Food Recommendation**:
   - This feature calculates the daily nutritional needs of babies based on their age and compares them with the total nutrients in the food consumed by the user.
   - It utilizes **Content-Based Filtering** to recommend the top foods based on nutrient gaps.
   - The recommendation is generated by calculating the cosine similarity between the nutrient differences and the food data.

2. **Check Stunting**:
   - A predictive model to detect the risk of stunting based on **age, weight, and height** input by the user.
   - The prediction is powered by **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** for binary classification, determining whether a user is at risk of stunting (`1`) or not (`0`).

### Tools and Libraries
The development and implementation of the machine learning models were completed using the following tools and libraries:
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the ANN and recommendation models.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and array manipulations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For preprocessing tasks (e.g., normalization using MinMaxScaler) and evaluation.

### Dataset
- **Description**:  
  - **Check Stunting**: Uses `check-stunting.csv`, a dataset containing age, weight, height, and stunting risk labels. This dataset was compiled manually by gathering data from trusted health and nutrition platforms, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), and other recognized health sources.
  - **Check Nutrition and Food Recommendation**:
    - `AKG-bayi.csv`: Contains daily nutritional requirements for babies based on their age. This dataset was sourced from [AndraFarm](https://m.andrafarm.com/_andra.php?_i=daftar-akg).
    - `food-check.csv`: Contains the nutritional composition of various food items, such as categories, descriptions, and nutrient values. This dataset is available on [Kaggle - Food Vitamins, Minerals, Macronutrient Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/food-vitamins-minerals-macronutrient).

- **Source Creation Process**:  
  The datasets were compiled manually by gathering data from the sources mentioned above. They were further cleaned, standardized (e.g., units in grams and liters), and formatted for model training.

### Machine Learning Workflow
#### **1. Check Nutrition and Food Recommendation**
   - **Input**: Age of the baby (in months) and the details of food consumed (category, description, and amount).
   - **Preprocessing**:
     - Filtered the data for the relevant baby age and food inputs.
     - Nutrient values in the food data were scaled based on the portion size (e.g., in grams or ml).
     - Normalized the nutrient data using **MinMaxScaler**.
   - **Model**:
     - A **Content-Based Filtering** approach was used to recommend foods based on the cosine similarity between nutrient gaps and available food items.
   - **Output**: Top N food recommendations that best fulfill the baby's nutritional needs.

#### **2. Check Stunting**
   - **Input**: Age, weight, and height of the child.
   - **Model**:
     - Built using **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** for binary classification.
     - Structure:
       - **Input Layer**: Accepts age, weight, and height as input features.
       - **Hidden Layers**: Configured with ReLU activation functions.
       - **Output Layer**: A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function to predict stunting risk (`1` for at risk, `0` for not at risk).
   - **Output**: A binary prediction indicating the risk of stunting.

### Results
- **Check Nutrition and Food Recommendation**:
  - Displays the baby's daily required nutrients, total nutrients consumed, nutrient differences, and top food recommendations based on relevance scores.
- **Check Stunting**:
  - Provides a binary classification result to indicate whether the child is at risk of stunting.
